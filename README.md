# Crusader Kings 3 Playset Preserver: GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

This script reads playsets from the CK3 launcher and retrieves its mods, either from the Steam Workshop folder (subscription is required) or from your local mod folder. It then merges all of these mods into a new, single mod.
## Why?
The problem we face with each official CK3 patch is asynchronous mod updates. This results in an issue where some mods are updated, while others are not. Since Steam does not have the option to download older versions of mods, players are left with incomplete or broken playsets. It can take months before all mods in a large playset are updated.
## How?
A "snapshot" of a current playset of your choice is created, which is stored locally without further updates. This way, it will be possible to continue existing campaign or play older versions of CK3 until your favorite mods are updated.

## Step-by-Step Guide:

1. Unzip the folder from the downloaded .zip archive into your mod folder. This folder is usually located at:<br/>\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod<br/>You will need an archiving utility, such as 7-Zip (free, open source, and cross-platform), to unzip .zip files.

3. Run CK3_PP.exe. This will launch the automatic installer.
  
4. Follow the on-screen instructions. The process is automated, so just enter the required information when prompted.

5. Once the process is done, the preserved playset will appear in your launcher (a restart of the launcher is required)
