## CMM Playset Preserver: GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Unzip the folder inside the downloaded .zip archive into your mod folder (usually at \Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod). You need an archiving utility like 7-Zip (free, open source, cross-platform) to unzip .7z files effectively.

2. Place the .json of your playset in the mod folder. If you are new to this, follow these steps:<br/>
2.1 Open CK3 launcher via Steam<br/>
2.2 Select "Playsets" on the left<br/>
2.3 Choose your playset in the dropdown menu and press on the three points next to it for options<br/>
2.4 Select "Share", then select "DOWNLOAD FILE"<br/>

3. Run CMH-PP.exe. This is the automatic installer.
  
4. You will be prompted to enter the Steam directory path and other information. The process is automated, so simply follow the on-screen instructions.

5. Once the installation process is complete, the playset will appear as a mod in your mod folder. You can now select it as any other mod in your launcher.
